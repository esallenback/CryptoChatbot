ML tutorial using basic neural network and only 2 layers to predict hand drawn digits. Currently in the process of trying to figure out which model will be best used for NLP
This tutorial uses relu (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/relu) in hidden layers and softmax for the final output layer
(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/softmax)
We will probably not use recitified linear in any of our layers for our final model because it is a poor predictor for natural speech
