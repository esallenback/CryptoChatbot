To use downloadwithchrome.py, download the chromedriver at 
http://chromedriver.chromium.org/ and move it to the autodownload folder.

Also install the module `selenium` by running the command ```bash pip install 
selenium``` on your console.

After installing requirements.txt you must install precompiled models and have them 
available in your $PATH from NLTK.
To do so in a python interpreter:
```
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('punkt')
```
